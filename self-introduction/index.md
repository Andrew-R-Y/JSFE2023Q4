Hello, everyone!

My name is Andrew, and this is a small presentation about me, and about my education in Rolling Scopes School.

In 2005 I graduated from Russian State University of oil and gas by Gubkin and became an engineer with a degree in oil and gas trunk pipeline transportation. Since then I have been working as an engineer.

I am currently working in Moscow as a pipeline engineer in small private oil pipeline design company, at position Chief Specialist. I have experience in oil pipeline calculations and design, and experience in general customer office as a technical contractor. I like physics and mathematics and I am interesting in coding. My best qualities are persistence and drive for results.

I started to learn JavaScript in summer 2022 from 11-hours YouTube video by Bogdan Stashchuk and freeCodeCamp platform.
There are several reasons why I started coding.
The first reason is that I am looking for something that I will enjoy. It has always been interesting for me what complex and mysterious things programmers do.
The second reason is diversification, my current skills are conducive to working in one country, mainly for state-owned companies, while private business attracts me much more.

I chose JavaScript because it is one of the most popular programming languages, and although, as experienced programmers say, the first language is only the entrance to the profession of a programmer and the choice of a specific language does not play a decisive role.

I want to note that in comparison with the Turbo Pascal language that we touched on at the university, the very great flexibility of the JavaScript language is striking.

In 2023 I discovered the Rolling Scopes School training course. From the beginning of July to November I studied at Stage #0, I enjoyed doing the "Library" project, because it was necessary to wrote a lot of code in JavaScript, to made a DOM manipulations, and also, due to usage of Local Storage, our web page looked like a full stack application with the ability to authorize users. I completed the task with the maximum score, like many of my classmates, and enjoyed completing the task.

I like studying at the Rolling Scopes School, although, compared to university education, the Rolling Scopes Front-end developer course is far more intencive. For me, this is a new challenge.
At the beginning of Stage #1 in 2023 my dream was to make a minesweeper game at the end of the year. And voila i made a nonograms game at the beginning of 2024!
Not a 100% coincidence, but great result. To be honest, I liked doing the logic much more than the game interface.

Thank you for your attention and I wish you good luck in your studies and peace!
